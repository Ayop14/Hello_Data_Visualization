# HELLO DATA VISUALIZATION 

## Motivation
This is my first project in my data science specialization roadmap. The idea is to design my own projects and solve real world projects that could arise during **real scenarios**. 

As a Junior computer scientist I realized I have a long way to learn about the field. That' s why I hand designed a roadmap for myself, inspired in MITT, Harvard and popular Data science courses. This is the first stone towards being a profesional ML engineer. 

## Introduction

This project focuses on the **science** behind data visualization, not any data visualization software in particular. The idea is to know *why* certain visualization work and which doesn't. Psicology, intuition, **and making a point** have a huge role in it.

Its focused on the book **Fundamentals of Data Visualization**, by **Claus O. Wilke**, and supported on a few youtube videos, tutorials, and *junior computer scientist stack overflow searching shenanigans*.

## Objective

The objective is to make practice about the points the book makes. Try to create visualizations where knowing that chapter information truly makes a diference, or solves a problem. 

To make visualizations I need ***DATA***! I've been really interested in 125CC bikes recently, so I build a dataset with lots of information about the current offer of 125CC bikes. That will motivate myself to ask the correct, and if possible complicated questions about the data. At the same time, it might clear my mind on which one to choose, hehe~

The idea is to read a chapter, and make a question to the dataset that can be answered with a correctly designed data visualization. 

## Dataset
As previously stated, it's a dataset of new 125CC Bikes. In the future, I don't discard making the same for 125-500CC bikes. The features are as follows:

- **Brand**: Brand that offers the Bike
- **Name**: Name of the bike model
- **Consumption (km/l)**:
- **Acceleration (0-100km/h)**:
- **Max Speed (Km/h)**:
- **Bike type**:
- **Power (kw)**:
- **Rpm max power**,
- **Cilinders**:
- **Refrigeration**:
- **Torque (Nm)**:
- **Rpm max torque**:
- **Weight full (kg)**:
- **Seat height (mm)**:
- **Gasoline capacity (l)**:
- **Price (eur)**:
- **Number of gears**:
- **Brake pistons**:
- **Front brake disk size (mm)**:
- **Back brake disk size (mm)**:
- **Length (mm)**:
- **Width (mm)**:
- **Height (mm)**:

## Legal details...?


## Future Work

- Advent of code - pandas
- Interactive web-based dashboards
